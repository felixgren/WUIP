## Code Review!
1. It is ideal to keep bundled production builds and dev seperate, makes the code hard to read.
2. Font size should be increased, not fully grandma proof. [Blue mark](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/751191596011225168/822034075455848458/codereview.PNG)
3. Some text seems to merge together on my devices, and an arrow seems to be missing z-index. Firefox 87.0.

5. Good use of meta tags, would be great to utilize the meta_image for embeds.
6. Really sweet and unique website, well fought on all those SVGs!
7. Very fast load speed/low bandwidth usage. High lighthouse score.
8. Fun use of scrollevents, nice to see.
